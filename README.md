Wiredcraft Full-stack Developer test
-------------------------

Make sure you read **all** of this document carefully, and follow the guidelines in it.

## Background

Build a [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) like app but for lighting talk polling.

Sorry no mock here, please make a simple and beautiful page that get the job done. We don't mind whether it looks as great as **Hacker News**.

## User Story

1. User open the page and could see a list of lighting talks order by rating submitted by other user;
2. If there's no lighting talk, simply put a placeholder text and encourage user to submit their own talks;
3. The user could vote for the lighting talk by clicking the voter button or icon;
4. After voting the user will get an updated version of the lighting talk list(order by rating);
5. User could always submit a lighting talk with `title`, `description`, and `username`;
6. The user could see his lighting talk on the list after submitting; 

### Functionality

* The **front-end** part should be a single page application rendered in the front-end and load data from restful api(**not** rendered from back-end);
* There should be a **back-end** and database to store the lighting talks

## Getting started

There's nothing here, we leave it to you to choose the build tool, code structure, testing approach...

## Requirements

- Use [loopback](http://loopback.io/) to build the back-end(because we are using this for our back-end project and we hope you feel comfortable to work with it as well).

- Use any **front-end** framework as you like.

- With clear **documentation** on how to run the code.

- Provide proper unit test.

- Use git to manage code.


## What We Care About

Feel free to use any libraries you would use if this were a real production app, but remember we're interested in your code & the way you solve the problem, not how well you can use a particular library.

We're interested in your method and how you approach the problem just as much as we're interested in the end result.

Here's what you should aim for:

- Good use of current HTML, CSS and JavaScript & performance best practices.

- Solid testing approach

- Extensible code;

## Q&A

* Where should I send back the result when I'm done?

Fork this repo and send us a pull request when you think you are done. We don't have deadline for the task.

* What if I have question?

Create a new issue in the repo and we will get back to you very quickly.
